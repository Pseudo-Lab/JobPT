** We're on a mission to transform spoken communication for individuals, teams
and organizations. Meetings are an information rich channel for productivity,
but much is lost due to lack of structure and information flow. At Supernormal
we're solving this problem with focus, design, and craft.  
  
We've been working on this since 2019 and have customers like Snap,
Salesforce, Replay, Gitcoin, Pinterest and thousands more. We are growing
rapidly and are excited for new teammates to join. We hire people who are the
best at what they do. We are building a team that is as diverse and creative
as the millions of people we serve worldwide.  
  
Supernormal is a remote first company and does not require co-location. We
have annual team retreats and gatherings several times a quarter.  
  
**About The Role  
  
** Machine learning engineers at Supernormal build the AI that superpowers the
core product experience for people's meetings including transcription, note
generation, and task automation. The AI team builds reliable and secure
services that use the most advanced AI models in the market to generate
millions of high-quality meeting notes to a rapidly growing customer base. Our
work revolves heavily around software engineering, too - we are looking for
people with a drive to roll up their sleeves and get new models and features
out to users as quickly as possible.  
  
**What You'll Work On  
  
** As an ML Engineer on Supernormal's AI team, you'll lead the full
development cycle of AI solutions for meeting notes, question answering, agent
conversations, and task completion. Your responsibilities will include prompt
engineering, agentic workflows using LLM APIs, custom model training, fine-
tuning, and optimizing deployment for cost, latency, and quality. Key projects
include:  
  

  * Prompt engineering using state-of-the-art techniques to improve the core meeting assistant scenarios 
  * Building and shipping machine learning models to improve transcript quality, reduce API token usage, eliminate LLM output defects, and extract semi-structured data 
  * Training and deploying custom language models (LoRA, RLHF, instruction-tuning, etc.), fine-tuning models for diverse business needs 
  * Creating new NLP & LLM-driven product experiences that improve with user feedback, collaborating with product and design teams 
  * Improving our LLM-powered search and question answering using retrieval augmented generation (RAG), everything from defining and improving quality metrics to optimizing our infrastructure 
  * Advocating for, and building, new and better ways of doing things. You'll leave everything you touch just a bit better than you found it   
  
  

**Requirements  
  
** **What you will bring  
  
** We are a fast-moving startup building zero-to-one products on top of large
language models. The ideal candidate has a strong machine learning background
and a hacker mindset, someone who can both spin up Jupyter Notebooks to train
models and also excel at writing reliable, high quality production code for
deployment. Requirements for the job include:  
  

  * Production-level AI/ML Experience: Demonstrated proficiency in AI/ML with a track record of at least 3-5 years experience building machine learning systems. We require skills for shipping and maintaining ML in production settings 
  * Experience delivering products and services using GenAI: 1+ year experience building NLP systems using LLMs, including proficiency with data curation/cleaning/labeling, fine-tuning/training models, and evaluating generative text output. Experience with RAG systems or conversational agents is a plus 
  * Software Engineering Competency: A solid engineering background with a robust foundation in software engineering principles. Must have comfort and excellence in writing code for and supporting production engineering systems. 
  * A Solid Educational Foundation in AI/ML: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, AI, Mathematics, or related field; Master's degree or PhD a plus 
  * Proficient in Python: our AI stack uses Python and interfaces with Ruby on Rails and Typescript (bonus if you know these, but not required.)   
  

**What we'll expect of you  
  
**

  * A collaborative mindset, focused on lifting others and improving daily 
  * A drive to tackle tough problems and do hard things 
  * High agency and initiative in bringing and building ideas 
  * Willingness to learn and improve existing approaches 
  * Emphasis on shared ideas and collective responsibility 
  * A growth mindset when facing challenges, aiming for team improvement   
  

**What you can expect from us  
  
**

  * We're a fully distributed team spread between Pacific Time (California) and Central European Time (Stockholm) with lots of places in between. We'll see you most days in Slack, Google Meet, GitHub issues, and Notion. Sometimes in person in a place with a warm breeze 
  * We're a friendly bunch and are happy to pair, talk through, or otherwise assist any time 
  * Honest and timely feedback. We're all better when we can have candid conversations about what is and isn't working 
  * A willingness to listen to your ideas: how can the codebase, our product, or team be better?

a diverse set of backgrounds--an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform
an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven
experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held,
and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and
expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it's holding
a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in
machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design
philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence
U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and
helping each other be successful.
